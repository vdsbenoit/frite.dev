      I was in charge the transition of the company towards DevOps fundamentals. It involved efforts both on the technical and human sides.
      This achievement elevated me to a Senior position within the company.

      During my first year at Sony, I had the opportunity to analyze the development processes of the company. 
      Since I was informed about the latest innovations on this topic, I accepted to take a new DevOps position. 
      <br /><br />
      My goal was to ease developers' lives by automating the most repetitive operations from their work habits. 
      To do so, I analyzed every team requirements and tried to identify what slowed them down and what could improve the quality of their work. 
      I then though about solutions and challenged them with what our infrastructure could provide. 
      When necessary, I suggested upgrades to the infrastructure in order to provide the best services to the developers. 
      Finally, I documented all my work, shared it, and performed a follow-up of the deployment of the solutions inside of the company.
