      As for most of the front-end developers today, Tailwind has become
      my favorite CSS framework. It provides a set of pre-defined classes
      that can be used to style your components, making it easier to
      create consistent and responsive designs.

      Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level
      virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. In
      one of my previous professional experiences, I used Docker to
      containerize all the possible build environments of the company's
      software. I used to maintain all of these Docker images
      programmatically, with the best DevOps automation practices. It
      allowed the company to have a wide range of consitent build
      environments, available across all the developers' machines and the
      CI/CD servers.
